## Tips and tricks


###  Most useful
Hash maps! If you don't know what you're doing, you'll probably make some progress if you throw one at it.

Stacks and Queues, use built in arrays in python.

Sets and DFS


### Hash Maps

Straight up just dictionaries in Python. They store data under an index in k, v pairs. You can cast an array to a dictionary using the 'enumerate' method.

'''
seasons = ["fall", "winter", "spring"]
enumerate(seasons)... [(0, 'Spring'), (1, 'Summer'), (2, 'Fall'), (3, 'Winter')]

'''
