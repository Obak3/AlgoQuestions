## Technical Prep!

#### Coding
1. Construct / traverse data structures
2. Implement system routines
3. Distill large data sets into single values (conditional branching?)
4. Transform one data set to another

#### Algos
Expected to know the complexity of an algo and how to improve or change it.
1. Big O analysis: understanding is pretty important
2. Sorting and hashing
3. Handling obscenely large amounts of data

#### Sorting
1. Know the details of at least one "n*log(n)" sorting algorithm.
        2. Quick sort and Merge sort would be great
2. Merge sort can be useful in circumstances where quicksort isn't practical.
3. What common sorting functions are there?
4. When are they efficient and when are they not?
5. What does efficiency mean when talking about time and space complexity?

#### Data Structures
1. Study up on as many DS and A as you can.
2. Know the common ones like the traveling salesman, knapsack problem
3. NP Complete: "**any of a class of computational problems for which no efficient solution algorithm has been found**".

Which to know?
These:
4. Trees
5. Tree construcion
6. Traversal and manipulation algos
7. Hash tables
8. stacks
9. arrays
10. linked lists
11. priority queues

#### Hashtables and maps
Arguably the single most important DS. Implement one using only arrays in your favorite language.

#### Trees
Recommend you know about the basic tree construction, traversal, and manipulation algos. You should be familiar with binary, n-ary, and trie trees at the least. You need to also be familiar with
