# Notes for the Google Interview prep.


## This was the material that THEY provided.


### Interview Tips

#### Substantive and Explain
1. Make sure what you say in your Resume supports what you can actually do, anything on there is fair game.
2. Explain your thought process!!
3. They assess your ability in a technical sense as well as how you approach a problem and how you try to solve it.
4. Questions are open ended on purpose... they want you to ask clarifying questions!
5. Explicitly state and check any assumptions that you would need to begin a solution!!!!

**THINK OUT LOUD**

#### Clarify
Ask clarifying questions if you don't understand the problem or if you need more info! They're purposefully vague because the engineers want to see how you engage with oen of them. They're particularly looking for what you view to be the most important piece of the puzzle that you've been presented. TAKE THE TIPS SERIOUSLY. They're trying to help you so you have to think through these and see where they are likely applicable!

#### Improve
Always be thinking about ways to make it more optimal and be FLEXIBLE to new ideas.

NEEEEED
1. You have to get the brute force solution as fast as you can.
2. After you get the brute force solution, discuss the tradeoffs // time and space comp.
3. Code. They don't want pseudocode, they want actual insights as to your technical ability
4. If you don't remember the exact method off the top of your head, say that you don't but you know what it does.

#### Ask Questions
At the end of the interview, you need to ask questions about the company, the culture, etc.
