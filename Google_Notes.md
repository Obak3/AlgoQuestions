#### Substantive and Explain
1. Make sure what you say in your Resume supports what you can actually do, anything on there is fair game.
2. Explain your thought process!!
3. They assess your ability in a technical sense as well as how you approach a problem and how you try to solve it.
4. Questions are open ended on purpose... they want you to ask clarifying questions!
5. Explicitly state and check any assumptions that you would need to begin a solution!!!!
