# CrackingMyCodingInt

This is a **personal** repo that is designed to keep me accountable as I prepare for interview season. I'll list week by week what I'm doing, what I accomplished, etc. This will be updated frequently.     

### Tracking Problems

| Question | Solution | Additional Insight |
| --- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Two Sum | Create a hashmap so you have constant lookup time and don't have to iterate again. | Try to use hashmaps wherever you can, you'll probably get SOMEWHERE. |
| Linked List Cycle | You're not given the index position to see if it's truly linked. So either do a while loop and add to a set because you can't have duplicate values or use a two pointer solution. | Two pointer solutions are kind of sick, try to use them where you can and run some problems with just those. |

I got an interview at Google! Look at the README for updates on how I prep.
