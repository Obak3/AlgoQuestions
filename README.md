# CrackingMyCodingInt

Tracking my questions that I complete on LeetCode for interview prep and for fun honestly. Below is the

## Question List

| Question Name | Approach | Insight |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Two Sum | Brute force is to use two loops for the first val and check the rest of the values. Optimal approach is ahashmap that you update so you can access it in constant lookup time. | When in doubt, see if you can cast things to a HashMap to reduce lookup time and not get exponential time complexity |
 | Remove Vowels | Just iterate through it once and add elements not found to the answer string. You could use replace but that's also doing iteration at a lower level. | I don't think this will be used in an interview, but you can use '+=' to put something onto the end of a string in Python. |


## DS/A I'm focusing on:

1. Arrays
2. Hash Maps
3. Trees
4. Stacks
5. BST's
6. Strings
7. Graphs
8. Queues
9. Heaps
