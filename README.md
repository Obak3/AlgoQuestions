# CrackingMyCodingInt

This is mainly to keep me accountable for prep work!

Below is my list of questions, feel free to use them (if anyone is actually using this).
The questions are basically just the top questions from all DS/A categories w/o any overlap.

## Question List

lol I'm just going to go through the 'Top Interview Questions' from LC and then target MSFT

| Question Name | Approach | Insight |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Two Sum | Brute force is to use two loops for the first val and check the rest of the values. Optimal approach is a
hashmap that you update so you can access it in constant lookup time. | When in doubt, see if you can cast things to a
HashMap to reduce lookup time and not get exponential time complexity |

Questions for Today:
1. Two Sum
2. Add Two Numbers
3. Three Sum

## DS/A I'm focusing on:

1. Arrays
2. Hash Maps
3. Trees
4. Stacks
5. BST's
6. Strings
7. Graphs
8. Queues
9. Heaps
