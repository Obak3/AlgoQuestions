# CrackingMyCodingInt

Tracking my questions that I complete on LeetCode for interview prep and for fun honestly. Below is the

## Question List| Question Name | Approach | Insight |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Two Sum | Brute force is to use two loops for the first val and check the rest of the values. Optimal approach is a hashmap that you update so you can access it in constant lookup time. | When in doubt, see if you can cast things to a HashMap to reduce lookup time and not get exponential time complexity |


## DS/A I'm focusing on:

1. Arrays
2. Hash Maps
3. Trees
4. Stacks
5. BST's
6. Strings
7. Graphs
8. Queues
