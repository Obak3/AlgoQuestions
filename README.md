# CrackingMyCodingInt

This is a **personal** repo that is designed to keep me accountable as I prepare for interview season. I'll list week by week what I'm doing, what I accomplished, etc. This will be updated frequently.     

### Week 1     

1. Big O Notation.... Don't want to look like an idiot    
2. Going through the Tech Questions and Requirements ala CTCI and other resources.    
3. Several array problems in two different complexities to help the understanding.  


I got an interview at Google! Look at the README for updates on how I prep.
