	3. Sort the problems by Acceptance, then by Difficulty  
	4. GOAL: Be able to solve Mediums without any resources  
	5. Spend 45 min or less on the problem  
	6. Sort by Most Views within the discussion tab  
	7. Understand the solution and break them down to understand the underlying concept

	9. There's no magic number of questions to solve!!!  
	10. Take place in the weekly contests
